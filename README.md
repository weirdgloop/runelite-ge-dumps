# Real-time GE data dumps

This repository contains .csv dumps of real-time Grand Exchange data from our API (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RS:PRICES). At the moment, we only host dumps for seasonal servers (like seasonal Deadman Mode) after their conclusion. Files are gzip compressed and need to be extracted.

We only provide dumps of data at 5 minute intervals. Prices will be the average price for a 5 minute interval.

We do not offer support for the dumps available here. Please only download/clone this repository if you are confident with data analysis.
